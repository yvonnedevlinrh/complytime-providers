# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Breaking Changes

- **ampel-provider**: Renamed granular policy IDs from benchmark-coupled `BP-X.YY` format to semantic, benchmark-agnostic slugs (`require-pull-request`, `minimum-approvals`, `block-force-push`, `prevent-admin-bypass`, `require-code-owner-review`). Updated corresponding `meta.controls[].id` references to semantic control IDs.

### Features

- **ampel-provider**: `LoadGranularPolicies` now recursively walks subdirectories to find policy JSON files, enabling structured policy source directories. Includes symlink safety (skips symlinks), duplicate policy ID detection (returns error naming both paths), and uses `os.Root` for TOCTOU-safe file reads.
